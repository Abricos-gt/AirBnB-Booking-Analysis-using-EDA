    "📌 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a fundamental step in understanding the structure, quality, and patterns within a dataset before drawing conclusions or building predictive models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we perform a comprehensive EDA on an AirBnB listings dataset to uncover meaningful insights about pricing behavior, geographic distribution, host characteristics, and market dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The focus of this analysis is not predictive modeling, but rather:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understanding the dataset deeply\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cleaning and validating the data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Visualizing patterns effectively\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extracting actionable business insights\n",
    "\n",
    "Through systematic exploration and visualization, this project aims to transform raw listing data into meaningful knowledge."

    "🌍 About the AirBnB Platform\n",
    "\n",
    "AirBnB is a global online marketplace that connects property owners (hosts) with travelers seeking short-term accommodations. Founded in 2008, the platform has expanded rapidly and now operates in over 220 countries and regions worldwide.\n",
    "\n",
    "AirBnB offers diverse lodging options, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Private rooms\n",
    "\n",
    "- Entire apartments or houses\n",
    "\n",
    "- Shared spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unique stays (e.g., treehouses, villas, castles)\n",
    "\n",
    "This diversity allows travelers to choose accommodations that match their preferences and budget, while hosts can generate income from unused or underutilized spaces."
